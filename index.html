           Manifesto: The Fragile Web of Consciousness, Desire, and Ideology

Introduction: The Illusion of Autonomy

In this manifesto, I intend to challenge the traditional conceptions of human emotions, identity, and autonomy through a rigorous analysis of the unconscious mind and its role in shaping our daily lives, both as individuals and as members of a broader societal system. As a schizophrenic actor, filmmaker, and student of psychology, I straddle the worlds of internal chaos and external perception, presenting an intimate understanding of the fragmentation of consciousness, and how ideology capitalizes on this disarray to sustain power. Drawing upon Derridean deconstruction, Slavoj Žižek’s critique of ideology, and Robert Sapolsky’s insights on determinism, we will unveil the disturbing truth: our desires, beliefs, and identities are not expressions of an inner freedom, but rather the products of a deeply orchestrated system from which we cannot easily escape.

The Unconscious: A Terrain of Primal Fear and Desire

Sigmund Freud once described the unconscious as a repository of repressed desires, traumas, and primal fears. In many ways, this dimension of the mind operates as a hidden stage where the scripts of our actions are written without our conscious participation. For Derrida, the "play of différance" exposes the instability of meaning, showing how language, thought, and action are haunted by the unconscious structures that evade presence. Similarly, human emotions — often idealized as the authentic expressions of the self — are actually heavily mediated by unconscious processes.

At the core of these emotions lies a tension between primal fear and the ever-evolving drive to desire. Žižek argues that human beings do not simply desire things; we desire to desire. This is crucial because it shifts the focus from the object of desire (be it love, power, or freedom) to the structure of desire itself, which remains eternally unsatisfied. Our emotions, from joy to anguish, are little more than ripples on the surface of this infinite, underlying drive. Fear, often seen as a natural reaction to external danger, is instead one of the fundamental tools by which ideology operates, subliminally coercing us into specific behavioral patterns. Our minds are layered in such a way that we are only dimly aware of this machinery at play.

The schizophrenic mind, far from being a deviation from the norm, offers a revealing glimpse into this unconscious abyss. Where the "normal" subject maintains a tenuous sense of coherence, the schizophrenic subject exposes the fragmented, polyphonic nature of consciousness. My lived experience shows that our sense of a unified self is a fragile construct, a thin veneer over a chaotic network of impulses, fears, and desires. This instability is something we all share but which ideology — through culture, language, and social norms — works hard to repress and conceal.

Ideology as the Unseen Puppet Master

Slavoj Žižek, building on the works of Marx, Lacan, and Althusser, has made a career out of demonstrating how ideology is the invisible force shaping not only our perceptions of the world, but our very identities. The power of ideology, Žižek argues, is not that it imposes beliefs on us directly, but that it structures our very sense of reality. We internalize ideologies so deeply that they function as the background of our lives, going unnoticed, yet guiding our actions, desires, and emotions.

To borrow from Derrida, ideology works through a series of différance — deferred meanings and contradictions that give the appearance of freedom and choice while subtly coercing us into predetermined roles. Our emotions, the love we feel for a partner or the anger we direct towards an injustice, are often not our own; they are pre-scripted responses embedded in the ideological framework we inhabit. Žižek's critique of late capitalism, for example, reveals how the system perpetuates itself by allowing us the illusion of rebellion, but always within the confines of consumerist logic — we are "free" to express our individuality through the commodities we purchase, but this freedom never challenges the overarching system.

The schizophrenic experience, marked by a breakdown of these ideological narratives, exposes the absurdity and contingency of the social order. What most people experience as a coherent, stable reality is, in fact, a finely tuned hallucination. We are all trapped within the ideological apparatus, only some of us are more aware of it than others.

Determinism: The Orchestrated Nature of Our Lives

Neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky’s work on human behavior offers a vital contribution to this discussion. Sapolsky asserts that our sense of free will is largely an illusion, as our thoughts, desires, and actions are determined by a combination of genetic, environmental, and biological factors. This deterministic view further supports the idea that we are not the autonomous agents we believe ourselves to be. In fact, what we experience as conscious decision-making is often the end result of processes that began long before we were aware of them.

Our emotions, desires, and thoughts are products of this complex system of causality, which includes not only our biology but also the ideological structures we internalize. From a Sapolskian perspective, we are more like marionettes than free agents, with our strings being pulled by a combination of neurotransmitters, cultural norms, and unconscious impulses. The schizophrenic mind, which often experiences these forces as overwhelming and disorienting, reveals the extent to which we are all governed by unseen determinants. The difference is that the neurotypical subject is better at rationalizing this orchestration, creating narratives of self-control and autonomy that mask the underlying determinism.

The Desire to Desire: The Engine of Ideology

At the heart of this manifesto lies the insight that human desire is not a straightforward pursuit of specific objects or goals but a more complex phenomenon: the desire to desire. Žižek, drawing on Lacan, explains that desire is always mediated through the Other, meaning that we desire not directly, but through the desires and expectations of those around us. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle in which our desires are never truly our own but are always already shaped by ideological forces.

Our emotions are therefore not spontaneous eruptions of inner truth but rather orchestrated responses that maintain the ideological order. We feel love, fear, joy, or anger in ways that reinforce the social system because these emotions are encoded with ideological meaning. For example, the love we feel for our families is intertwined with cultural narratives of family values, which in turn support specific political and economic structures. Even our most intimate experiences are shaped by forces beyond our control.

Conclusion: Embracing the Absurdity of Identity

The ultimate insight of this manifesto is a troubling one: our identities, thoughts, desires, and emotions are not the products of some inner essence but are the result of a complex system of unconscious processes, ideological conditioning, and biological determinism. We are not in control. The schizophrenic experience, often dismissed as a form of madness, reveals the inherent instability of the self and the ways in which our minds are colonized by forces we can barely comprehend.

But there is also a strange freedom in this realization. If we can accept that our sense of self is a fiction, a carefully constructed narrative imposed by ideology, then we might begin to play with that fiction. Derrida’s concept of play suggests that meaning is always in flux, that there is no final truth or fixed identity. By embracing this instability, by acknowledging the orchestration of our lives, we might find a way to resist the deterministic forces that govern us — not by seeking a return to some mythic, autonomous self, but by learning to navigate the complex web of forces that shape our lives with awareness, humor, and a radical openness to the absurdity of it all.

In the end, we may never escape the systems that control us, but we can at least learn to see the strings. And in that seeing, perhaps there is the beginning of a new kind of freedom — not the freedom to control our lives, but the freedom to let go of the illusion that we ever could.
